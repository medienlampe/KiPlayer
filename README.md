# KiPlayer

This is a fastly hacked-together script to autoplay an array of video files during a conference.

## Usage

-   add your video files to the media-folder
-   copy or rename app.dist.js to app.js
-   change the movies-array at 'KiPlayer configuration' inside app.js to match your media files
